<p>The progress bar in the footer is cute.
What's your goal with this letter? In terms of length I can imagine that it might show that your position is solid so it's useless arguing and you two may as well put that behind you. I'm not saying that you're closed minded of course (as you, I'm open to evidence but not to supernatural claims unbacked by evidence) but she's probably unchangable and a large bulky letter like this will entrench this standoff.
If that's your goal then I don't think that's a bad one. A biologist that is able to deny evolution must have very sophisticated compartmentalisation!
If you've got a long-term goal of deconversion however then I have a few suggestions,</p>

<script type="text/javascript">
  var _gauges = _gauges || [];
  (function() {
    var t   = document.createElement('script');
    t.type  = 'text/javascript';
    t.async = true;
    t.id    = 'gauges-tracker';
    t.setAttribute('data-site-id', '4ef1144df5a1f53f69000017');
    t.src = '//secure.gaug.es/track.js';
    var s = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];
    s.parentNode.insertBefore(t, s);
  })();
</script>
</body>
