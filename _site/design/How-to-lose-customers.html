      <p>Your app earns customer loyalty when it improves their quality of life, but when customers abandon it, they are telling you that your app does not make life better for them anymore. You can hope that an exodus won't be socialized, but it's too late. Your application will die alone.</p>

<p>It takes a lot of work to attract customers; it takes even more effort to keep them coming back.</p>

<p>Instead of making customer retention your sole motivation, focus on developing features because they improve the lives of your customers in a meaningful way. Nothing alienates the very customers you're trying to keep around like desperation.</p>

<h2>Quotes</h2>

<blockquote><blockquote><p>[People] require a seemingly contradictory mix of freedom and expectation—expectation to coordinate, for example, and also to measure progress toward common goals.

<p>If you're not saying “HELL YEAH!” about something, say “no.”…Every request to start a new project. If you're not saying “HELL YEAH!” about it, say “no.”

<h2>Lines</h2>

<p>Avoid making customer retention the guiding motivation behind what you choose to build. That alienates the very customers you're trying to keep around. Rather, choose to develop features because they improve the lives of your customers in a meaningful way.</p>

<p>Instead of developing features because they improve the lives of your customers in a meaningful way, make customer retention your guiding motivation. Nothing alienates the very customers you're trying to keep around like desperation.</p>

<p>It doesn't matter if there's a prize for winning. People like to play. They like to tally their progress and compare their ranking to others.</p>

<p>Spend a little time at the beginning offering a succint summary of what drives off customers. Then, spend the majority of the article focusing on a couple of suggestions that will keep customers around.</p>

<p>What drives away customers?
Poor motivation (building something to retain customers)
No reason to use the application every day</p>

<p>Without a reason to return to your application every day, your customers will find other things on which to focus their attention.</p>

<p>Avoiding the obvious: overloading an application with features. Designing the obvious says to "focus on focus." Applications should do one thing well. But let's not spend time beating a dead horse. By now everyone knows that saying "yes" too often will kill your app and drive away your customers.</p>

<p>Copy is design.</p>
