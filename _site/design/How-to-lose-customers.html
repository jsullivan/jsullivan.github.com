      <p>There are all sorts of reasons why customers abandon their loyalty to a company or its products. Sometimes it's because an app is broken, or outdated, or because it has terrible support.<sup>[<a id="footnote-1-ref" href="#footnote-1">1</a>]</sup> Sometimes the company supports something that offends its customers.<sup>[<a id="footnote-2-ref" href="#footnote-2">2</a>]</sup> But how do you keep your software from being abandoned when it's boring? A lot of guesswork has been removed, thanks to research in behavioral psychology and game theory. Here are ways to keep customers habitually using your software.</p>

<h2>Cultivate new habits</h2>

<p>We are creatures of habit.<sup>[<a id="footnote-3-ref" href="#footnote-3">3</a>]</sup> We routinely eat the same foods, wake up at the same time, and gripe about the same things to the same people. So, be an enabler. Consciously create habit-forming interactions between the customer and your software through operant conditioning.<sup>[<a id="footnote-4-ref" href="#footnote-4">4</a>]</sup></p>

<p>Positively reinforcing users as they interact with your software conditions them to expect to feel good when they use it. Your customers will crave more time with your software when their expectation to derive pleasure and happiness is met with reinforcement and rewards.</p>

<p><a href="http://commendablekids.com">Commendable Kids</a>, a 2010 Rails Rumble finalist, demonstrates a fine example of positively reinforced habit-forming user experience. Taking cues from the Boy Scouts of America, the app encourages kids by guiding their behavior with a simple badge-based rewards system. Every good-deed, skill, or accomplishment is rewarded by unlocking a badge that can then be shared with friends and family.</p>

<p>Conditioning a rat to tap a pedal for a food pellet is one thing, but cultivating complex habitual behavior in users requires testing, logging, and a series of successive approximations. B.F. Skinner, who developed the theory of operant conditioning, referred to this process as "shaping."<sup>[<a id="footnote-5-ref" href="#footnote-5">5</a>]</sup> In short, if you know the kind of habit you want to cultivate in your customers, and it's complex behavior, then begin shaping their habits by stepping them toward the final desired behavior over time. Don't expect to condition your customers into complex behavior without a series of steps to get them there. Train desired behavior every step of the way. The best way to do this is to iterate over the features you develop in small chunks, deploying often and getting feedback. This keeps you engaged with the customer and trains them toward the final behavior you expect, rather than pushing out a new feature whose complexity is repelling.</p>

<h2>Guide them like a boss</h2>

<blockquote><blockquote><p>[People] require a seemingly contradictory mix of freedom and expectationâ€”expectation to coordinate, for example, and also to measure progress toward common goals.
Gawande, Atul (2009-12-15). The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right (p. 79). Metropolitan Books. Kindle Edition."</p></blockquote></blockquote>

<h2>Make every day game day</h2>

<p>Fill space here with the book game based marketing. Talk about how I have been trying to come up with a compelling use of the prisoner's dilemma in G5's platform app. Talk about lonely app, invite over friends to play a game.</p>

<h2>Pit the customer against herself</h2>

<p>Localized leaderboards and progress goals.</p>

<p>It doesn't matter if there's a prize for winning. People like to play. They like to tally their progress and compare their ranking to their own past performance and to others.</p>

<p>People don't know what they want. Even when they say they do, they don't. (the study about fast food healthy meal from designing the obvious).</p>

<h2>One is the loneliest number</h2>

<p>Attracting new customers takes a lot of work, keeping them returning takes even more. Instead of making customer retention your sole motivation, focus on developing features because they improve the lives of your customers in a meaningful way. Nothing alienates the very customers you're trying to keep around like desperation. And, as developers of abandoned software know well, customers find other things to do with their time when there's not a constant reason to return.</p>

<p><sup id="footnote-1">1</sup> An alarming example of a customer support train wreck is Ocean Marketing's Paul  Christoforo responding to an inquistive customer about why he hasn't received any information about a purchased product. The entire email exchange was published at <a href="http://penny-arcade.com/resources/just-wow1.html">Penny Arcade</a>. <a id="footnote-1" href="#footnote-1-ref">&#8617;</a></p>

<p><sup id="footnote-1">2</sup> GoDaddy's CEO, Bob Parsons, in the span of a single year, has managed to offend a stunning number of its customer base, first with the video of his elephant hunt, and more recently GoDaddy's support of SOPA. <a href="http://gawker.com/5870851/has-godaddys-elephant+killing-ceo-finally-gone-too-far">Gawker</a> is a good jumping off point for more information. <a id="footnote-2" href="#footnote-2-ref">&#8617;</a></p>

<p><sup id="footnote-3">3</sup> In 2008, scientists tracked the movement of 100,000 people using geo-locatable data from their cell phones. The patterns of movement they tracked were so habitual that they could "obtain the likelihood of finding a user in any location." <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080604/full/news.2008.874.html">Nature</a> published the research.<a id="footnote-3" href="#footnote-3-ref">&#8617;</a></p>

<p><sup id="footnote-4">4</sup> I haven't come up with any real use for negative reinforcement, or punishment, in software. At least not any that I'd use. Maybe one day there will be  books like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/NurtureShock-New-Thinking-About-Children/dp/0446504130/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1324606843&sr=8-1">Nurture Shock</a> condemning too much reward and positive reinforcement in our software, rather than our parenting. Until then, never, ever punish your customers.<a id="footnote-4" href="#footnote-4-ref">&#8617;</a></p>
