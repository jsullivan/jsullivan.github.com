<p>This is an article about increasing productivity and reducing distractions with daily pomodoros. The Pomodoro Technique® is a way to get the most out of time management. Turn time into a valuable ally to accomplish what we want to do and chart continuous improvement in the way we do it. Francesco Cirillo created the Pomodoro Technique® in the 1980s. It is now practiced by professional teams and individuals around the world. I believe this article about productivity is a good one.I really do. Now, do you think it's well written? I can't really tell if it's well written enough to be published on my blog.</p>
