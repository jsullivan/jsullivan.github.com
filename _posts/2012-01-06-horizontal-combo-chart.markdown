I abhor pie charts. They can be terribly misleading, they're ugly, and research from Bell Labs indicates that comparisons by angle are harder to gauge than comparisons by length. Joyce Robbins, Ph.D., of Bell Labs advises that pie charts "do not communicate data well and should be used rarely."<sup>[<a id="footnote-1-ref" href="#footnote-1">1</a>]</sup> I assert that they should never be used at all.

Anyway, these horizontal combo charts may not be a much better display of data, but they're built completely in CSS3 and don't look as gimmicky. <a href="http://amerine.net">Mark Turner</a> and I created these for the new platform at G5.

These combo charts are easy to use and they're free. <a href="https://github.com/jsullivan/CSS3-Horizontal-combo-chart">Download them from Github</a>.
