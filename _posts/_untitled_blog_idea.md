## Pit the customer against herself

Leader boards are a great way for users to compare ranking. At G5, we are experimenting with an application of localized leader boards for our customers. An interesting benefit of leader boards is that they can be used to measure a user's progress against their own past performance, and they can be used to demonstrate rank among a larger group of users. To paraphrase Game-Based Marketing, it doesn't even matter if there's a prize for winning. People like to play. They like to tally their progress and compare their ranking to their own past performance and to others.
