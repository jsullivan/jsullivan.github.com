## Feature parody isn't feature parity

I don't have a good idea for this post or even an direction I want to lead the reader. I don't even have a point I want to make. I just like use "parity" and "parody" as a play on words.

Maybe this isn't worth a blog post - maybe it's only effective as a casual sentence in a better blog post. Anyway, I am capturing it here in case it can be salvaged and used later.
