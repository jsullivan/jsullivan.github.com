Csíkszentmihályi identifies the following ten factors as accompanying an experience of flow [3][4]

1. Clear goals (expectations and rules are discernible and goals are attainable and align appropriately with one's skill set and abilities). Moreover, the challenge level and skill level should both be high.[5]
2. Concentrating, a high degree of concentration on a limited field of attention (a person engaged in the activity will have the opportunity to focus and to delve deeply into it).
3. A loss of the feeling of self-consciousness, the merging of action and awareness.
4. Distorted sense of time, one's subjective experience of time is altered.
5. Direct and immediate feedback (successes and failures in the course of the activity are apparent, so that behavior can be adjusted as needed).
6. Balance between ability level and challenge (the activity is neither too easy nor too difficult).
7. A sense of personal control over the situation or activity.
The activity is intrinsically rewarding, so there is an effortlessness of action.
8. A lack of awareness of bodily needs (to the extent that one can reach a point of great hunger or fatigue without realizing it)
9. Absorption into the activity, narrowing of the focus of awareness down to the activity itself, action awareness merging.

Not all are needed for flow to be experienced.

Jane McGonigal recently proposed using the power of games to promote blissful productivity and social fabric in her recent TED video and book [14, 15]. Blissful produc- tivity refers to an ideal state of mind in which gamers are happier working hard (in the game) than relaxing. McGo- nigal also suggests that gamers will work hard all the time, when given the right kind of work. When people play games together, they build bonds, trust, and cooperation resulting in stronger social relationships, which Mcgonigal refers to as social fabric.
